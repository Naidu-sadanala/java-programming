    <p1>Sisters are a blessing for everyone in this world. Many of us have sisters whom we love unconditionally. Some have elder sisters while others have younger sisters. Nonetheless, we all are lucky to have been blessed with sisters. Through my sister essay, I will tell more about my sister and my unconditional love for her.

                <li>Sister is important in every person’s life, without which life seems a bit incomplete.</li>
                <li>I also have a lovely little sister named Dipti and affectionately called her Dipu</li>
                <li>She studies in sixth grade and always comes first in her class</li>
                <li>It loves art very much.</li>

        <h2><li>Younger Sister</li></h2>
            <p>I have a younger sister who is five years younger than me. She is my whole world and I cannot live without her. When I first found out that I’m a big sister, I couldn’t contain my happiness. I remember playing with her all day when she was an infant.
                </p>

            <p>My sister used to stop crying whenever I came back from school. As she started to grow up, we became even closer. Somehow, the age gap between us started to lessen and she turned into a friend of mine.
               </p>

             <p>I can share all my secrets with my younger sister. Even though she is younger than me, she does not act like it. She is a very mature girl who handles all my moods and whims accordingly.
                 </P>

            <p>Moreover, she is the one who makes me understand things sometimes when I cannot see them clearly. Moreover, she also makes everyone in our family laughs with her cute little antics. Everyone in my family adores her as she is the youngest member of our family.
